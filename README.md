# üêæ HapiVet ‚Äì AI Appointment Scheduler Prototype

## 1. Problem Statement
Currently, veterinary scheduling and task management are handled manually.  
This causes delays in urgent cases and inefficient workload distribution among doctors.  

Our solution automates the scheduling system using AI to categorize appointments as:
- **Normal (1‚Äì2 days)**
- **Urgent (2‚Äì4 hours)**
- **Very Urgent (Immediate, 0‚Äì1 hour)**

The chatbot automatically connects users with available doctors, reschedules rejected slots, and handles instant video calls using Jitsi Meet API.
